In the MyPage component that I will be implementing, users will have the ability to select a movie by its title and receive a list of recommended movies suggested by the system. The recommendations will be based on movies that share the same lead actor(s) as the selected movie. Additionally, users will have the option to provide feedback on whether they liked or didn't like the recommended movies. The system will then store this feedback and use it to avoid suggesting movies that the user didn't enjoy in future recommendations. This interactive and personalized movie recommendation feature will enhance the user's movie-watching experience and tailor the suggestions according to their preferences.
